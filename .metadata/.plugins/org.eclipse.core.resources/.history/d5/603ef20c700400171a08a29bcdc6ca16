/* Create a program that plays rock, paper,
 * scissors.
 * This program will need to:
 * 1. declare variables that will be used in
 * storing values for computer and user
 * guesses and score.
 * 1a. Form a while loop (a do-while could
 * be used but is not necessary) around the 
 * next elements of code that will determine
 * the winner (to win, score must be 2 greater
 * than opponent's score)
 * 2. determine the computer and user guesses
 * with Math.random and the Scanner class.
 * 3. Compare the guesses using if-else Statements.
 *  Assign the winner a point
 * 4. Show current Score.
 * 5. Quit the program when one opponent
 * is two points ahead of the other.
 * 6. Show the results of the game.
